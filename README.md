## Improvements to make 🌱
- The API only allows a certain number of calls per hour, so we added a default image if we reached the limit. But the default image always pops up for one second before the new image loads. Could fix this by lowering resolution of images. 
- Filter functionality to move completed items to bottom of list. 
- Allow background image to cover entire screen even after adding multiple tasks.
